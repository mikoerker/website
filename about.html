        <p>
            First-year Bachelor's student of Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam from Slovenia. Passionate about the intersection of technology, innovation, and problem-solving, and driven to explore how AI can shape the future. My education is giving me a solid foundation in machine learning, programming, and multidisciplinary thinking, which is and has prepared me to take on challenging problems and create intelligent systems.

        <p>
            Beyond AI, I'm fascinated by aerospace technology, particularly the science behind rocketry and space exploration, inspiring me to think big and push the boundaries of what's possible. Outside of academics, I stay active through my hobby of ultimate frisbee, which has taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn, grow, and push boundaries. My vision is to understand the power of AI and technology not just to analyze the world but to actively transform it through innovative and impactful solutions. Whether it’s collaborating on groundbreaking projects, exchanging ideas on emerging trends, or exploring new horizons, I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and organizations.
